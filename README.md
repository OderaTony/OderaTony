- 👋 Hi, I’m @OderaTony  and I work remotely as a freelance data scientist. I hold a Bachelor’s in science (Plant Science and Biotechnology, University of Nigeria,Nsukka).

- 👀 I’m interested in data anaylsis and data science,  I have always enjoyed to solve puzzles. So that’s how I look at big data sets: to me it is one big puzzle I want to solve.
 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on amazing and mind blowing projects. I have been working as a data scientist for more than five years with experience in transport, logistics and retail.
